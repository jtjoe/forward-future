		<h2> About</h2>
		<p>
			The purpose of Forward Future is to explore the possibility of 
			integrating 3D visualization into an online shopping <br/> experience. 
			Currently, retailers lose the ability to showcase a 360 degree full 
			detail view of their product when selling <br/> on the internet. The disconnect
		        between customer expectations and actual product can impact companies 
			negatively, with <br/> reputation and item return costs. Forward Future aims to 
			be a proof-of-concept for increasing customer engagement and <br/> satisfaction 
			through adding interactive 3D models into the company web store.
