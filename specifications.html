        <h2>Specifications</h2>
          <p>The final group project is an open-ended project for a multi-user webapp aiming to provide a solution to a real world problem.
            The final product should have functionality to enable user login and registration, a database with relationships, and make use of appropriate web development technologies.
          </p>

        <h3>Purpose of Project</h3>
          <p>The purpose of Forward Future is to explore the possibility of integrating 3D visualization into an online shopping experience.
            While convenient, online shopping has the disadvantage of limiting the visual information of the product.
            To many people details are especially important when deciding to purchase products such as clothing.
            Unexpected features can lower customer satisfaction and incurr additional costs for retailers.
            Modern technology, notably internet browsers and scripting language advancements, have enabled 3D models to be manipulatable inside a webpage.
            On Forward Future users will be able to view products from any angle, enabling them to view the details they deem important.
            They will also be able to customize an item and view their personalizations from a variety of perspectives.
          </p>

        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
          <p>Deliverables for this group project will include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A front end, multiple-page website utilizing React.js and A-Frame web framework</li>
            <li>Functionality enabling users to personalize and manipulate a 3D object of a product</li>
            <li>A backend, using Node.js and SQL for storing and retrieving data such as user login credentials</li>
            <li>Functionality enabling users to log in, access and modify personalized data</li>
