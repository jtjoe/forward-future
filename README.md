# forward-future
Project Specifications:
The final group project is an open-ended project for a multi-user webapp aiming to provide a solution to a real world problem. The final product should have functionality to enable user login and registration, a database with relationships, and make use of appropriate web development technologies.

Project Purpose:
The purpose of Forward Future is to explore the possibility of integrating 3D visualization into an online shopping experience. Currently, retailers lose the ability to showcase a 360 degree full detail view of their product when selling on the internet. The disconnect between customer expectations and actual product can impact companies negatively, with reputation and item return costs. Forward Future aims to be a proof-of-concept for increasing customer engagement and satisfaction through adding interactive 3D models into the company web store.
